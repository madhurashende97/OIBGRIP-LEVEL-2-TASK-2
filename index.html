                <p id="tribute">Nikola Tesla was born at 10th July, 1856 at the stroke of midnight with lightning
                    striking during a summer storm. He was born to a Serbian family in Smiljan,
                    near Gospic. Tesla soon demonstrated both his brilliance and insanity. While at the Austrian
                    Polytechnic in Graz, Tesla’s obsessive need to succeed so terrified
                    his professors that they warned his father that his son was putting his life at risk through
                    overwork. After moving to the US in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison,
                    Tesla soon found himself competing against his mentor and boss. In the fight to establish electrical
                    systems, Tesla’s plan for alternating current (AC) became
                    the preferred (and safer) mode to Edison’s direct current (DC). Backed by Westinghouse and other
                    corporate powerhouses, Tesla rose quickly to become one of the
                    brightest and most inventive minds in America. His relentless curiosity and energy led to him
                    receiving 212 patents for inventions in radio, remote control, radar
                    and x-ray technology. But that same energy pushed him to embrace ideas that most considered
                    outrageous, if not a bit insane.</p>
                <p id="tribute">“One must be sane to think clearly,” Tesla said in his defense. “But one can think
                    deeply and be quite insane.” Often his projects
                    sounded more like science fiction plots than new technology. His “Teleforce” death ray, he claimed,
                    will be able to concentrate energy to
                    “bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's
                    border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.
                    " He abandoned his own plans to develop an earthquake machine, fearing it might “split the Earth
                    like an apple.”</p>
                <p id="tribute">Obsessive, brilliant, and tortured, Nikola Tesla was lauded for his invention of the
                    alternating current (AC),
                    and other significant contributions to science. His claim that "harnessing the forces of nature was
                    the only worthwhile scientific endeavor"
                    both impressed and enraged the scientific community. Eventually, his peers could no longer dismiss
                    his eccentricities and began to view him as a crackpot -
                    a potentially dangerous one. Although Tesla's work was a major factor in the success of the second
                    Industrial Revolution, he died alone, on January 7, 1943, impoverished,
                    and largely shunned by the scientific community that once hailed him a genius. Beset by visions,
                    without a wife or children, Nikola Tesla's brilliant
                    mind changed the world, even though at the time of his death he passed unnoticed into obscurity.</p>

                    <li><strong>1881 EMPLOYED AS ENGINEER IN BUDAPEST</strong> Thanks to family friend Ferenc Puskas,
                        who was working with his brother Tivadar on installing the first telephone exchange in Budapest,
                        Tesla obtained employment as a “chief electrician” in the Central Telephone Office. Here he
                        built his first invention, a device for voice amplification on the telephone.</li>
                    <li><strong>1882 INVENTION OF THE ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELD</strong> Walking with his friend Anton
                        Szigety in the Budapest City Park, watching the setting sun and reciting verses from Goethe’s
                        “Faust”, he discovered the principle of creating a rotating magnetic field with alternating
                        current.</li>
                    <li><strong>1883 IN STRASBOURG BUILD’S WORLD’S FIRST INDUCTION MOTOR</strong> Sent to Strasbourg to
                        repair a direct current electrical system which could not be successfully commissioned.
                        According to the diary he kept at the time, he worked on the repair from October 14, 1883, to
                        February 24, 1884.</li>
                    <li><strong>1888 UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE APPROVES HIS PATENTS FOR AN INDUCTION MOTOR AND A
                            SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY</strong> The
                        basic patents for the polyphase system, “Electro Magnetic Motor” no. 381.968, “Electrical
                        Transmission of Power” no. 382.280, “System of Electrical Distribution” no. 381.970, and another
                        four patents were granted to him on May 1. From 1888-1891 he secured a total of 36 patents which
                        allowed him to completely develop what was known as the Tesla Polyphase System, and created the
                        basis for the second industrial revolution.</li>
                    <li><strong>1891 INVENTS THE RESONANT TRANSFORMER</strong> Patent no. 454.622 for this new device
                        was granted on June 23. Today it is known throughout the world as the Tesla Coil.</li>
                    <li><strong>1896 WORLD’S FIRST HYDROELECTRIC PLANT, BASED ON TESLA’S PATENTS, BEGINS
                            OPERATION</strong> On the night between November 15 and 16, the first large alternating
                        current hydroelectric plant was put into operation on the Niagara River. The first kilowatts
                        were transmitted from Niagara to the city of Buffalo, about forty kilometers away. Of the twelve
                        patents used in construction of this plant, nine belonged to Nikola Tesla.</li>
                    <li><strong>1897 ESTABLISHES THE BASIS OF RADIO TECHNOLOGY</strong> Tesla built a new and bigger
                        radio station and transmitted radio signals over a distance of more than forty kilometers. He
                        submitted two key patent applications for radio. “System of Transmission of Electrical Energy”,
                        no. 645,576, describes a system of four resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency and a
                        system of transmitting and receiving antennas. Patent no. 649,621, “Apparatus for Transmission
                        of Electrical Energy”, describes the radio apparatus.</li>
                    <li><strong>1898 DEMONSTRATES OPERATION OF “TELEAUTOMATON” BOAT</strong> At the first exhibition on
                        electrical apparatus in Madison Square Gardens, he demonstrated the famous experiment in which
                        he controlled the movement of a model boat remotely using radio waves. He submitted a patent
                        application under the title “Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vehicle
                        or Vehicles”, no. 613,809 on July 1. It was granted by the US Patent Office on November 8 that
                        year. Aware of the great importance of this patent, he protected it in eleven countries.</li>
                    <li><strong>1907 BUILDS THE FIRST WORKING MODEL OF A BLADELESS TURBINE</strong> In the field of
                        mechanical engineering, Tesla discovered the original principle of the propulsion of fluids
                        which he applied to pumps, turbines, compressors and fans. This finding, which he had conceived
                        in 1890 and formulated at the beginning of 1902, was first presented to scientific experts on
                        June 1, 1906, and applied in practice during 1907.</li>
                    <li><strong>1928 FINAL PATENT</strong> In his 72nd year he was granted his final patent for
                        “Apparatus for Aerial Transportation”. He was the first to imagine a flying machine with
                        vertical take-off and landing, a combination of helicopter and fixed-wing which would be powered
                        by his turbines.</li>
